# Asteroid Defence!
Initially made by Cary Small and myself (Oliver De Bruin).
## How the game came about:
This game was made during an 18 hour game hackathon hosted by Derivco, where we placed second. I have been continuing the game here.
## Please feel free to download and look at the source.
## We do not own any of the assets used in this game, they were all provided.
